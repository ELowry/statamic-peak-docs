# Deployment script

You can use the following deployment scripts together with Peak to make sure everything runs smoothly after a deploy.

## Deploy script Ploi

```bash
if [[ {COMMIT_MESSAGE} =~ "[BOT]" ]] && [[ {DEPLOYMENT_SOURCE} == "quick-deploy" ]]; then
    echo "Automatically committed on production. Nothing to deploy."
    {DO_NOT_NOTIFY}
    exit 0
fi

cd {SITE_DIRECTORY}
git pull origin {BRANCH}
{SITE_COMPOSER} install --no-interaction --prefer-dist --optimize-autoloader --no-dev

npm ci
